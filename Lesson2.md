# Lesson 2: Variables  

Programs would be quite boring if all values were known and constant. At times, programmers may need to utilize containers to store certain values. These containers are called *variables*.  

Variables are widely used in computer programs. For example, a variable would be utilized to store somebody's username and password on a website.  

Variables can store a variety of things, such as numbers, `true`/`false` values, characters, and strings.
