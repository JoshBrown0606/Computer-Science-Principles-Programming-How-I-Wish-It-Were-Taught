# Lesson 2: Variables  

Programs would be quite boring if all values were known and constant. At times, programmers may need to utilize containers to store certain values. These containers are called *variables*.  

Variables are widely used in computer programs. For example, a variable would be utilized to store somebody's username and password on a website.  

Variables can store a variety of things, such as numbers, `true`/`false` values, characters, and strings.  

To create a variable in pseudocode, the `name ← value` syntax is used. For example, if you were to create a variable called `a` and assign the value 5 to it, the code would be written as:  

`a ← 5`
